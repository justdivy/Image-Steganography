📖 About The Project
StegoVault is a sleek and powerful web application that allows you to hide and retrieve secret messages within images. Using the art of steganography, your confidential information becomes an invisible part of a seemingly ordinary picture, making it undetectable to the naked eye.

This project showcases a full-stack implementation with a beautiful, responsive frontend built using React & Tailwind CSS, and a robust, efficient backend powered by Python.
